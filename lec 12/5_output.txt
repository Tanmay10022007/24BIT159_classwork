AS YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CONVERT OTHER THAN STRING DATA TYPES TO STRING DATA TYPE BEFORE WRITING (REFER READ/ WRITE OPERATIONS), AND IF THE DATA IS IN THE FORM OF SET, DICTIONARY OR TUPLE, THIS TASK BECOMES MORE CUMBERSOME. IN SUCH CASES, USE A MODULE CALLED JSON.
SERIALIZATION: JSON MODULE CONVERTS PYTHON DATA TYPE INTO APPROPRIATE JSON TYPES BEFORE WRITING DATA TO A FILE. LIKEWISE, IT CONVERTS JSON TYPES READ FROM A FILE INTO PYTHON DATA (DESERIALIZATION).
SERIALIZATION OF A PYTHON TYPE TO JSON DATA IS DONE USING A FUNCTION DUMP(). IT WRITES THE SERIALIZED DATA TO A FILE.
DESERIALIZATION OF A JSON DATA TO A PYTHON TYPE IS DONE USING A FUNCTION LOAD(). IT READS THE DATA FROM A FILE, CONVERTS THE DATA AND RETURNS THE CONVERTED DATA.
